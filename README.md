This is an updated version of Elektriktrick to run on MacOS 14. It will require you to build the [FLTK](https://www.fltk.org) project which is a submodule of this repo. Follow the instuctions to build FLTK with Xcode as the linking depends on the location of the build products. 

Build the FLTK project first, then build the application Elektriktrick which will build the quicklook extension. After you run the Elektriktrick you should be able to quicklook STL, DXF, and GCODE files. 

You may have to logout or reboot to see the effect.
